# Credential-Management 
## What is Credential-Management? 
In a larger organisation where Credentials are at the crux of keeping a high-profile and a sizable user base and workforce secure. Credential management, or credential management systems, are systems or mechanisms that allow the administration of the life cycle of user credentials (issuance, modification, or revocation) that an organization operates with. This system is part of what is known as the public key infrastructure (PKI), which is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.

## Why Is Managing Credentials Important? 
Organizations require user credentials to control access to sensitive data and services. However, those credentials hold significant potential for abuse if not appropriately managed. Much like an entity or individual goes through different roles and responsibilities during their tenure in an organization, so must the credentials they hold. Credentials that are not quickly purged when the user leaves the organization pose a significant risk. 

## Steps to perform Credential-Management. 
1) Reconnaissance (i.e. Gaining the suitable information of the victim and analysing credentials) 
2) Brute-forcing with random passwords to gain access. 
3) After Gaining access further exploitation and draining data. 
4) Clearing evidence of attack.
