# Credential-Management 
## What is Credential-Management? 
In a larger organisation where Credentials are at the crux of keeping a high-profile and a sizable user base and workforce secure. Credential management, or credential management systems, are systems or mechanisms that allow the administration of the life cycle of user credentials (issuance, modification, or revocation) that an organization operates with. This system is part of what is known as the public key infrastructure (PKI), which is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.
